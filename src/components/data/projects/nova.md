# Nova GSAP — Cinematic Interactive Animation

**Nova GSAP** is an interactive web experience showcasing **smooth, cinematic UI animations** using the **GSAP animation library** and scroll-driven interaction patterns.  
The project combines motion design with dynamic scroll triggers to create immersive transitions and interactive sections.

Animations include scroll reveals, element transitions, and timeline-based motion that respond to user scrolling and UI interaction. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## What Users Experience

- **Dynamic Scroll Animations** — Sections animate into view with fade, slide, and stagger effects
- **Cinematic Timelines** — Motion sequences coordinated with scroll position
- **Responsive Design** — Motion and layout work across screen sizes
- **Performance-First UX** — Animations optimized to avoid jank and lag

---

## Key Features

- **GSAP + ScrollTrigger** — Core animation logic powered by GreenSock’s animation engine :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
- **Smooth Section Transitions** — Coordinated animations that guide users through content
- **Interactive Motion Sequences** — Elements animate based on scroll position
- **Tailwind CSS** — Lightweight utility-based UI styling
- **Vite** — Fast build system for development and production

---

## Why I Built This

- To master **advanced GSAP animation techniques**
- To create a **scroll-driven motion experience**
- To explore **timeline sequencing and performance tuning**
- To deliver a **portfolio-ready interactive project**

---

## Tech Stack

### Frontend

- **GSAP** – Animation engine for timelines and scroll triggers :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
- **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first responsive design
- **Vite** – Modern frontend tooling for fast builds
- **Vanilla JavaScript** – For animation logic and DOM handling

### Deployment

- **Vercel** – Hosted live with instant access

---

## Development Experience

### GSAP Animation Logic

- Built reusable animation functions and timeline sequences
- Leveraged ScrollTrigger for scroll-based motion control
- Ensured animations didn’t block rendering or affect layout during scroll

### UI & Responsive Animation

- Designed motion that adapts for mobile and desktop breakpoints
- Used Tailwind for consistent spacing, typography, and layering
- Created fluid transitions between sections

---

## Impact & Results

- Live, **interactive animation experience**
- Smooth transitions throughout the user flow
- Demonstrates advanced motion design skills
- Strong foundation for future dynamic UI projects

---

## Future Enhancements

- **Dynamic Content Sections** — Load content and animate as users scroll deeper
- **3D & Parallax Effects** — Add layered motion for depth
- **Configurable Timelines** — Let users toggle motion intensity
- **Accessibility Enhancements** — Reduce motion for preference settings

---

## Key Learnings

- How to orchestrate animation timelines with GSAP
- Efficient use of ScrollTrigger for scroll-linked motion
- Combining UI design with motion principles
- Frontend performance considerations with smooth animation
